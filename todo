figure out where to put in discrete->continuous conversion code. it currently
depends on grid_, but how do i feed that to graph state and all its objects?


add free angle to hash function

exceptnion stuff for static configuration

clean up collisionspacemgr (it really only deals with arm model right now)

maybe change the name of occupancygriduser to something like discretizer? it
uses a bunch of stuff other than occup grid

delete arm model files
